## Get Started
- The API provides GET, POST, PUT & DELETE HTTP methods.
- The user is able to read, create, update and delete players from the database.
- To get started, modify the application.properties file to match your own database configurations.
- Once that's done, run the project. By default, it runs on http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players.
- For DELETE and PUT, the default url is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players/{id}, where id is the players ID.
- To get player by id, use the url http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players/id, where id is the player's ID.
